## Install

```
# install this package using NPM
$ npm i -D cypress-playwright
# or using Yarn
$ yarn add -D cypress-playwright
```

If using Cypress, add this package to your [Cypress support file](https://on.cypress.io/support-file)

```js
// cypress/support/e2e.js
import 'cypress-playwright'
```

VoilÃ¡ you can now run your Playwright tests in Cypress and Cypress tests in Playwright! Plus use `await` keyword with all Cypress commands:

```js
// Cypress spec
await it('works', async () => {
  await cy.visit('/')
  const $el = await cy.get('selector')
  expect($el).to.be.visible
  // or use "should" assertions
  $el.should.be.visible
})
```

Want to open 2nd tab and test your chat application? No problem!

```js
// Cypress spec
cy.get('selector button').click() // opens the second tab
// use PW syntax to wait for the 2nd tab to open
const secondPage = await context.waitForEvent('page')
await newPage.waitForLoadState()
// continue using Cy to test the second page
cy.get('selector on the second tab').type('something')
// now close the 2nd page and switch to the first
cy.get('close button selector').click()
// or simply use
await newPage.close()
// we are back on the first page!
```
